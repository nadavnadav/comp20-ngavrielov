	<div class="finding">
		<h3>1: Inserting any data</h3>
		<h4>Issue</h4>
		<p>Inserting any data into the fields
		<h4>Location</h4>
		<p>/submit.json
		<h4>Severity</h4>
		<p>Very severe
		<h4>Description</h4>
		<p>You can pretty much insert anything into the fields. For example, I inserted a picture of Richard Nixon into the username field. But someone with more malicious intentions could insert something more dangerous, particularly in the form of Javascript.
		<h4>Proof</h4>

		<img src="curl_nixon_hack.png">
		<h4>Resolution</h4>
		<p>This issue can be fixed by escaping the data that the user inputs. For instance, the characters < and > could be escaped so as to prevent special tags from being inserted as data.

		<h3>2: Submitting extra fields into the database</h3>
		<h4>Issue</h4>
		Inserting extra data
		<h4>Location</h4>
		/submit.json
		<h4>Severity</h4>
		Moderate
		<h4>Description</h4>
		You can insert extra data by including extra fields, as indicated below. This can be a problem because it wastes space in the database. Plus, someone could store something malicious in an extra field.
		<h4>Proof</h4>

		<h4>Resolution</h4>
		The post request should be limited so as to only accept the specific fields that are required.

	<div class="finding">
		<h3>3: Cross domain requests</h3>
		<h4>Issue</h4>
		Cross domain requests from anywhere
		<h4>Location</h4>
		The app.js
		<h4>Severity</h4>
		Severe
		<h4>Description</h4>
		Cross domain requests are enabled for anywhere because of the *. This could be dangerous as it opens the floodgates to anyone who wants to submit such a request.
		<h4>Proof & Resolution</h4>
		Thus a resolution is to limit it to a specific domain. Perhaps a URL with a white list of domains.

		<h3>4: Accessing all data</h3>
		<h4>Issue</h4>
		Easy to obtain access to all data [found with the help of Sid and George Brown]
		<h4>Location</h4>
		/scores.json
		<h4>Severity</h4>
		Very severe
		<h4>Description</h4>
		Anyone who puts "$[ne]" for one of the fields can gain access to all of the data.
