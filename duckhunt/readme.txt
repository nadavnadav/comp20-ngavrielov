Nadav Gavrielov's Duck Hunt Game!
Date: 2.24.13
Time Spent: 1.5 hours
Everything seems to have been done correctly. One thing I am curious about is whether I should have made the sizes of the dog and the
birds any bigger than they are in the image (because in the actual game they seem to be larger than in the source file).

I asked Jonathan Gilad and George Brown a few questions.
