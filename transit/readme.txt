Nadav Gavrielov's MBTA Map:

Loads a map based off of the user's location, which is denoted by an elephant.
Depending on the results of the MBTAMap JSON, it renders the correct MBTA line on the map.
The stations are denoted by the color icons. The stations are connected by an appropriately colored line.
The station name can be found by clicking on the station.
When a station icon is clicked on, the schedule for the station and upcoming trains appears.
The map also shows the nearest station in the appropriate line to the current location, and when the current location icon is clicked on, show's the distance to that station.
