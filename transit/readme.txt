Nadav Gavrielov's MBTA Map:

Loads a map based off of the user's location, which is denoted by an elephant.
Depending on the results of the MBTAMap JSON, it renders the correct MBTA line on the map.
The stations are denoted by the color icons. The stations are connected by an appropriately colored line.
The station name can be found by clicking on the station.
Not functional yet (but will be after break): train schedules and the 'closest station' feature.
