This repository is for aggregating all of the work that I have done this semester in comp20!

Favorite project was the MBTA map because it took a lot of hard work and felt really rewarding when I completed it. Plus it is very practical in terms of having an easily accessible MBTA map schedule, teaching me how to use the Google Maps API, and how to parse schedule info and display it.

I am most proud of the MBTA map project because I put in a lot of effort into it and was able to make it both useful and visually appealing.

I think I have learned a ton in this class. Back in January I had a few relatively vague ideas about HTML and CSS and that was pretty much the extent of my web programming knowledge. Now I feel like I have really delved into the foundational topics in web programming and learned a ton, from databases to javascript to HTTP to using the Google Maps API. Its all very practical.
